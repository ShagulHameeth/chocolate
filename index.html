              <h3>HOW IT TASTES</h3>
              <p>
                Limited Edition No. 3 is a close cousin of The First Forty coffee, albeit a rare one. 
                While the inspiration of The First Forty came from the flavours of courage from the story of a coffee estat
                e manager, Limited Edition No. 3 was born out of a playful and joyous accident.During the early years of coffee 
                in Brazil, in early 1800s, coffee plantations had already burgeoned into a main crop for a lot of farmers. One such
                 farmer was picking his harvest for the day when one of his kids picked up some beans and safely planted them in their 
                pockets thinking them to be berries that he can eat later. The kid emptied his pockets on the roof of their house 
                thinking that to be the safest place on earth for his loot of the day. He would eat the pulp of a few beans every day 
                and would keep the half-eaten beans back on the roof. After a few days, the pulp dried up making them useless for the 
                kid before he was caught by his father. Without wasting any of it, the farmer proceeded to use those beans for himself,
                and roasted a cup of coffee that had more complex flavours than any he has ever produced. The rest, as they say is 
                history.

                Organic cocoa and chocolate
                The organic cocoa market represents a very small share of the total cocoa market, estimated at less than 0.5% of total production. ICCO estimates production of certified organic cocoa at 15,500 tonnes, sourced from the following countries: Madagascar, Tanzania, Uganda, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Venezuela, Fiji, India, Sri Lanka and Vanuatu.
                
                However, the demand for organic cocoa products is growing at a very strong pace, as consumers are increasingly concerned about the safety of their food supply along with other environmental issues. According to Euromonitor International, global organic chocolate sales were estimated to have increased from a value of US$ 171 million in 2002 to US$ 304 million in 2005.
                
                Certified organic cocoa producers must comply with all requirements associated with the legislation of importing countries on production of organic products. The benefit for cocoa farmers is that organic cocoa commands a higher price than conventional cocoa, usually ranging from US$ 100 to US$ 300 per tonne. However, originating countries with smaller volumes can fetch much higher premiums. This premium should cover both the cost of fulfilling organic cocoa productio
                n requirements and certification fees paid to certification bodies.</p>

                Cocoa beans are stored in silos or warehouses in their original sacks. Imported raw cocoa is subject to strict quality control. Laboratory technicians ensure that the beans are healthy, perfectly fermented and dried, and have suffered no damage during transport. Silos, measuring from 40 to 120 feet in height can store up to 1000 tons or more. The raw cocoa is sucked up by powerful vacuums and fed into the silos.

                The storage area must be isolated from the rest of the building to protect the sensitive beans from strong odors that might be absorbed. Good air circulation and a cool temperature are important, and the humidity regularly checked. You must be able to identify the beans according to their particular type and origin in order to control the flavor by blending beans for roasting.
